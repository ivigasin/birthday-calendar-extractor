Generated calendar file saved in `ICS` format - a universal calendar format used by several email and calendar programs, including Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.

How to use
Just click extension icon, popups will guide you through step-by-step. Each click on the icon will bring you closer :)
At the end of the process file named `birthday-calendar.ics` will be downloaded automatically to your Downloads folder.
Use generated file to export your friends' birthdays to your calendar program.

Important!
There is no easy way to remove birthday events from the calendar later!
At your calendar I suggest to create a new Birthday themed sub-calendar and use it for imports.
