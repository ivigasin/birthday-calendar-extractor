Generated calendar file saved in `ICS` or `CSV` formats.

How to use
Click on extension icon and select on of required formats:
* Generate Google Calendar - ICS is a universal calendar format used by Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.
* Generate Excel file - CSV
* Remove from Google Calendar - Generated file used to remove all already exported birthday events.

At the end of the process file named `birthday-calendar.ics` will be downloaded automatically to your Downloads folder.
Use generated file to export your friends' birthdays to your calendar program.
I suggest creating a new Birthday themed sub-calendar and use it for imports.

FAQ
Q: I accidentally saved birthdays to my main calendar, how to reverse it?
